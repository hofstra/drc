* [ ] can we relate people to projects? So if you specify a person post, or data or collection entry by id in the frontmatter of a project post, could we load that person's headshot, name, department, as a sidebar on the project page? I seem to recall that being pretty straightforward in jekyll, but I can't be sure. If you think that's an easy thing to add within scope, great.
