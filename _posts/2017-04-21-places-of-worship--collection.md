In the year 2000, Hofstra University alumnus Robert L. Harrison began his quest to photograph all the places of worship in Nassau County. Eighteen months and over 3000 miles later, he had completed a stunning visual record of the religious diversity in this rapidly changing area of Long Island. This collection contains all of the images captured by Harrison during his photographic odyssey.(Note: Harrison added a small number of photographs to the collection in 2002. Also, the collection does include some photographs of places of worship located in Suffolk County).
