The Weingrow Collection of Avant-Garde is the gift of Muriel and Howard L. Weingrow. This collection consists of some 4,000 original illustrated books, manifestos, periodicals, catalogs, posters, prints, manuscripts, photographs, film, and records, which represent the Dada, Surrealist, and Expressionist movements. Also included are samples of many other movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries as well as selections from the second Avant-Garde movement of the late 1960s, and the movement known as the New Realism.
