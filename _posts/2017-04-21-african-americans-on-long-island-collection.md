Included are court documents (including certificates of acquittal, certificates of conviction, petitions, and warrants); examinations and judgments from pauper hearings; servant and slave indentures (bills of sale); manumissions (formal emancipations from slavery); minutes of court proceedings, many of which concern manumissions; slave receipts; correspondence; and a poster.
