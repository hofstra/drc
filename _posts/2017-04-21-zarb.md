Frank Zarb has been a cabinet member or an advisor to five United States Presidents. He is a graduate of Hofstra University (BA 1957 and MBA 1962) and has served in the US Army. He may be best known, however, as the “Energy Czar” when he worked in the US Energy Department and played an integral part in the US fuel allocation program during the oil crisis of the 1970’s or, as the Chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange in the late 1990’s.
