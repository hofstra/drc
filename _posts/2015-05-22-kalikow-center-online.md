The Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency hosts several panels on U.S. presidential leadership and policy making every semester that feature scholars, journalists, and policy makers.  For students, faculty, and guests who are unable to attend, Hofstra’s Digital Research Center provides an opportunity to review the discussion.  The DRC will host video coverage of Kalikow Center panels (including those in the Center’s symposia and conferences) to advance the Center’s commentary and analysis in multiple research agendas, for students, faculty, journalists, and others interested in presidential studies.
