The term “popular culture” evades easy definition. For some, it is any aspect of culture that is aimed at and appreciated by a large segment of a society. Some conceive of it as inherently unsophisticated, standing in opposition to higher forms of culture. Others consider it to be necessarily commercialized, and primarily existent to make money. This collection includes comic books, graphic novels, newspapers, magazines, realia and books.
