Harbor Hill was a Gold Coast estate located in Roslyn, Long Island, New York, and owned by the Mackay Family. The property on which the estate was built was given to Clarence Mackay and Katherine Duer Mackay as a wedding gift in 1898 by Clarenceâ€™s famous parents, John W. Mackay and Marie Louise Hungerford. The house was the site of many elaborate parties, including grand celebrations honoring the Prince of Wales, and Charles Lindbergh. Charles Hechler was the superintendent of Harbor Hill from 1907-1938. The estate was eventually demolished in 1947.
