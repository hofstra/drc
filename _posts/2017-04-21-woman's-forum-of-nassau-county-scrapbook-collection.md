The Woman’s Forum of Nassau County was founded in 1944 by Elizabeth Bass Golding. Organized to discuss problems of common concern, the Forum hosted conferences, panel discussions, programs, meetings, etc., that dealt with topics such as alcoholism, aging, housing on Long Island, high school trade schools, town government, and the morality of Off Track Betting. The organization grew rapidly and eventually united more than 500 groups of different races, creeds, nationalities, and interests.
