This two-day conference focuses on how to create a Digital Research Center (DRC) at Hofstra that will enable faculty and students to develop digital solutions to critical and scholarly problems. Panels will explore strategies
for interactive and collaborative research, integrating scholarship and pedagogy through online digital tools, and the DRC’s proposed scholarly websites. Workshops will acquaint participants with MIT’s Annotation Studio (annotation) and other HyperStudio tools, as well as with Hofstra’s TextLab (editing revision).
