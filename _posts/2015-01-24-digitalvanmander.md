The Digital Van Mander will offer the first authoritative English translation of Karel van
Mander's Grondt der Edel Vry Schilderconst (Foundation of the Noble Free Art of
Painting). This translation will be in the form of an interactive website.

Van Mander's "Foundation," a poem of about sixty pages, is the introduction to a
much longer work, Het Schilder-boek (The Painter's Book), first published in 1604. This
important book was Van Mander's response to the famous Italian model, Giorgio
Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, published in
1550. Van Mander's singular work, aimed at painters, poets and art connoisseurs,
combines instruction, an iconographic manual, a Dutch translation of Vasari's book, Van
Mander's own lives of great Netherlandish painters, and his translation and explanation
of Ovid's Metamorphoses. The book is not only a statement of current thinking about the
skills and social status of artists, but a manifesto for the creation of a native Dutch artistic
and cultural identity, composed in the wake of the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish.

There is no definitive English translation of the "Foundation," despite its
fundamental importance to Dutch art theory and values, and its influence in early modern
humanist culture in Europe.

The proposed digital English translation will make this work accessible to
readers for the first time in four hundred years. In addition to the translation, the website
will include a parallel text of the original Dutch, plus a facsimile of the 1604 edition. The
translation will be viewable on its own or alongside the Dutch text, along with notes,
links to other primary and secondary sources, and images. Users will be able to read (and
download) the translation, and follow the original digitized text, the original edition, and
hyperlinks to images, notes, and other relevant material. There will also be an opportunity
for users to contribute to discourse about the text and translation.
